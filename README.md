# pokemon-encounter-tables

## Concept
This is a single-page Typescript React web application that will present forms to the user to generate shareable, customized Pokémon encounter tables. For an introduction on what an encounter table is, check out [this article on Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Wild_Pok%C3%A9mon) or [see an example on Serebii](https://serebii.net/pokearth/unova/route6.shtml)

### Features
The application will include:
* Using information about specific games from the main Pokémon series or to customize the generator to the user's own labels
* Exporting the table as various common file formats (PNG, PDF, etc.)
* Responsive design that can also be manually altered, including a dark theme
* Options for uploading images like custom sprites and route previews
* Types of encounters from all main series games, as well as custom encounter types
* The ability to restrict or omit generations of pokémon, or choose a custom set of included pokémon

### Design

This page will be added onto as the intended functionality for the application grows.
