add grass & surf photos to public folder
remove example table, hook up table to represent data dynamically (set up data retrieval so that this can just work once all the pokemon's data has been populated)
added two CSS classes for the EncountersForm
changed encounterTypes object to EncounterTypes enum and used it to create the EncounterTypesInfo object, moving information about the encounter types out from other files and into the EncountersForm.tsx file
Added number buttons (encounter-number class name), but need to add reordering functionality
Changed Encounter Type buttons to an icon button group, but may need to change this again as more encounter types are added
Reordered buttons in PrimaryConfig.tsx, added a Clear button, and hooked up a Modal for the nullData load action.
Changed Rarity from a union type to an enum
Attempt to implement local state & callback hook solution for indicating to users that multiple encounters of the same type are present in EncountersForm.tsx (and TableData.tsx) COMMENTED OUT FOR NOW
Started adding the REORDER_ENCOUNTER action in DataContext.tsx COMMENTED OUT FOR NOW
